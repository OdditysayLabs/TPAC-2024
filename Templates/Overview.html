   <p>It is a four-year program to build a universal infrastructure, securing digital identity, which will meet the challenges of our increasingly interconnected global landscape.</p>
   <p>We will create a digital identity framework that empowers users with complete control, ensuring optimal privacy and trustworthy verification.</p>
   <p>We will be adopting two W3C standards, including Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials.</p>
   <p>The Digital Wallet leverages the industry‚Äôs leading Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) framework, offering several key benefits:</p>

  <section class=comment>
   <p>The Taiwan Digital Wallet will be open-source. We will release the Digital Wallet, Issuer SDK, and Verifier SDK for free, allowing all government agencies and private enterprises worldwide to use them.</p>
   <p>Global institutions can freely use and fork the software without prior approval.</p>
   <p>This will significantly accelerate the progress and growth of the verification industry and ensure that Taiwan‚Äôs Digital Wallet continues to meet the latest international credential standards.

   <h2>üå± Open Ecosystem</h2>
   <h3>For Issuer, Wallet, and Verifier</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Anyone can issue credentials, build a wallet, or conduct verifications without prior approval</li>
    <li>Foster competitive verification industry</li>
    <li>Facilitate international collaboration</li>
   </ul>

  <section class=comment>
   <p>Any entity, including government agencies and private enterprises, can freely issue credentials and conduct verifications.</p>
   <p>This fosters a competitive verification industry, encouraging the development of secure and reliable verification methods.</p>
   <p>It also facilitates smoother collaboration with international partners.</p>

   <h2>üß™ Sandbox Environment</h2>
   <h3>Playground for Innovation</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Testing features and functions</li>
    <li>Exploring ideas and creating new solutions</li>
    <li>Production environment unaffected</li>
    <li>Actively mitigate cyber risks</li>
   </ul>
  </section>

  <section class=comment>
   <p>We will also create a sandbox environment where these organizations can test their software and required verification features.</p>
   <p>This sandbox is a testing environment that allows developers to innovate and create new services without disrupting the production environment.</p>
   <p>It also enables cybersecurity experts to inspect new features early to ensure their security.</p>

   <p>To create a more secure and reliable verification ecosystem, the Taiwan Digital Wallet project will actively collaborate with all stakeholders from the outset.</p>
   <p>We will be holding a bi-monthly technical advisory meeting, allowing government agencies and private enterprises, who best understand the practical verification needs, to propose necessary system features.</p>
   <p>Interested developers will then compete to build these features, accelerating the iteration of the Digital Wallet system and uncovering more commercial potential.</p>
   <p>Lastly, the technical advisory meeting will discuss trust model for verifiable data registry, to develop Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) framework for securing digital identity.</p>
